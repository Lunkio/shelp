                            into an extra revenue stream by bringing in 
                            customers who pay real money for your surplus products. 
                            One sold product brings on average 4 euros to your 
                            bank account â€“ you'll do the math on what it means 
                            for your bottom line!

                            doesn't cannibalize your regular sales, as buying 
                            Shelp products brings awareness and new

                        <p>Following our best practices, you are likely to 
                            sell more than half of your surplus products 
                            with Shelp. Every product sold and not thrown 
                            away reduces unnecessary emissions caused by 
                            food production and shows you care about 
                            the environment.
