                        Throwing away products is bad business. Running out of
                        products and having empty shelves is also bad business. 
                        Let us help you sell your surplus products and turn it 
                        into good business.

                            Shelp turns the lost revenue from your unsold products
                            into an extra revenue stream by bringing in 
                            customers who pay real money for your surplus products. 
                            One sold product brings on average 4 euros to your 
                            bank account â€“ you'll do the math on what it means

                            doesn't cannibalize your regular sales, as buying 
                            Shelp products brings awareness and new

                            Following our best practices, you are likely to 
                            sell more than half of your surplus products 
                            with Shelp. Every product sold and not thrown 
                            away reduces unnecessary emissions caused by 
                            food production and shows you care about 
                            the environment.
